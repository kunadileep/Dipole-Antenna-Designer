## Overview

The project aimed to develop a MATLAB script and a graphical user interface (GUI) app to facilitate the design and analysis of a finite-length dipole strip antenna.

The main deliverables of our project are:
1. MATLAB Script (`main_script.m`)
2. GUI app (`DipoleAntennaDesigner.mlapp`)

`main_script.m` contains the hardcoded equations for the design of the antenna and generation of plots.

`DipoleAntennaDesigner.mlapp` uses the logic provided in `main_script.m` and provides an interactive interface for changing the parameters of the antenna and visualizing the results.

## Features

Our Dipole Antenna Designer app has the following features. It has three tabs:
1. Design Tab
2. Analysis-I Tab
3. Analysis-II Tab

The app enables users to input dipole antenna parameters:
1. Frequency
2. Length
3. Width
4. Maximum current phasor

In the Design tab and generates in the Analysis tabs:
1. A 3D mesh representation of the antenna
2. Impedance plot
3. 3D Radiation pattern plot
4. Current distribution plot
5. Azimuthal plot and Elevation plot

Plots are interactive, allowing users to examine and analyze antenna characteristics.
